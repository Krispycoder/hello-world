# hello-world
Behold! The time honored tradition that is ... Hello World!
This is just the beginning of my programming journey.
Krispycoder here and I'm excited to contribute to the GitHub community as well as
collaborate with others on challenging projects. I have a basic working knowledge of
C++ and Perl. I would like to strengthen my skills in these languages as well as learn 
Java and Javascript.
